# TEAM PROFILE GENERATOR

GIVEN a command-line application that accepts user input
WHEN I am prompted for my team members and their information
THEN an HTML file is generated that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on user input

WHEN I click on an email address in the HTML
THEN my default email program opens and populates the TO field of the email with the address

WHEN I click on the GitHub username
THEN that GitHub profile opens in a new tab


WHEN I start the application
THEN I am prompted to enter the team managerâ€™s name, employee ID, email address, and office number

WHEN I enter the team managerâ€™s name, employee ID, email address, and office number
THEN I am presented with a menu with the option to add an engineer or an intern or to finish building my team

WHEN I select the engineer option
THEN I am prompted to enter the engineerâ€™s name, ID, email, and GitHub username, and I am taken back to the menu

WHEN I select the intern option
THEN I am prompted to enter the internâ€™s name, ID, email, and school, and I am taken back to the menu

WHEN I decide to finish building my team
THEN I exit the application, and the HTML is generated
